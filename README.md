# Numerical_modeling_for_compressible_flows

This project consists of the study of the famous HLLC scheme of Toro, Spears and Spruce.
- understand the philosophy of the scheme: what can be the interest a priori? How is it built?
- to code the HLLC scheme in 1D, as well as the HLL scheme and to compare the two on the first two benchmarks,
(ยง6 - shock tube of Sod and test of Woodward and Collela).
- Extend order 2 of these schemas using the technique of your choice and study the impact of this extension on previous benchmarks.
- code the extension on 2D Cartesian mesh of these 2 schemes (HLLC + order 2 and HLL + order2).
